mod_name=RoadArchitect: Encounters
mod_description=Adds dynamic encounters to RoadArchitect roads. As you approach planned paths, ambient triggers spawn small ambush events (e.g., 4-5 pillagers) near the road when the chunk is loaded and a player is within range. Markers are placed along finalized paths and fire once per location to keep gameplay lightweight and fair.
